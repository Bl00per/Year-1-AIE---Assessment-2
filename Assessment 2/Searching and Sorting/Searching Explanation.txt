For my dynamic array I decided to add a linear search function. I chose this specific algorithm because the user may not sort the array before searching for a value and most algorithms depend on the array to be sorted before searching for a value. Another reason is because my array does not contain a large amount of data so the algorithm can efficiently search my array for the specified value.
